What to do?
===========

Place all photos into this "photos" directory and rename them
according to below conventions. The file extensions can stay
same as original file name.

All formats which are supported by PDF are supported, namely
JPEG, PNG.

Photos are rescaled so that resulting PDF is not extensively huge.
The rescaling is done with 300 DPI.


Front page photo
----------------

There is one photo on front page which is covering whole page.

Filename template: front-page.*
Example:           front-page.jpg


Week photos
-----------

Every week page contains one photo, it covers half of the page
either on the left or right depend on the side on which it it
printed, this allows to cut the calendar so that one can keep
photos and throw away the old calendar days.

The photos have to be named according to below template where
YYYY is year and WW is week of the year. Week has to have leading
zeros so week 3 has to be named as 03.

Filename template: YYYY-WW.*
Example:           2018-03.jpg
